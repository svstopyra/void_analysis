We describe and make use of a new algorithm for creating a single, unified void catalogue by combining different samples from the posterior. The catalogue is complete out to \$135\\, h^\{-1\}\\mathrm\{\\, Mpc\}\$, with void abundances matching theoretical predictions. Finally, we compute stacked density profiles of those voids which are reliably identified across posterior samples, and show that these are compatible with Λ cold dark matter expectations once environmental selection (e.g. the estimated \$\\sim 4\{\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\}\}\$ underdensity of the Local Super-Volume) is accounted for.},

	SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

	abstract = {We investigate the accuracy requirements for field-level inference of cluster and void masses using data from galaxy surveys. We introduce a two-step framework that takes advantage of the fact that cluster masses are determined by flows on larger scales than the clusters themselves. First, we determine the integration accuracy required to perform field-level inference of cosmic initial conditions on these large scales by fitting to late-time galaxy counts using the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. A 20-step COLA integrator is able to accurately describe the density field surrounding the most massive clusters in the local super-volume (\$\\lt 135\\, \{h^\{-1\}\\mathrm\{\\, Mpc\}\}\$), but does not by itself lead to converged virial mass estimates. Therefore, we carry out ‘posterior resimulations’, using full N-body dynamics while sampling from the inferred initial conditions, and thereby obtain estimates of masses for nearby massive clusters. We show that these are in broad agreement with existing estimates, and find that mass functions in the local super-volume are compatible with ΛCDM.},
