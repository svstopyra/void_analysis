A Catalogue of Rich Clusters of Galaxies
Abell, G. O., Corwin, H. G. Jr., and Olowin, R. P. 1988,
 Astrophys. J. Suppl., submitted.

The content of the Abell Catalogue data files is identical to the tables
published in Ap. J. Suppl. Series.  There are four data files:

nabell.fin:   final northern Abell catalogue
rich.fin:     final southern Abell catalogue
poor.fin:     supplementary southern Abell catalogue
sabell.fin    northern Abell clusters found during the southern survey

and all have exactly the same format.  An example with column headings is
given below.  Note that the northern Abell catalogue does not list xcen, ycen,
Abell type, m1, m3, m10, previous listings, or number of plates and observers.
The northern catalogue has also had all known errors corrected (Struble and
Rood (1987ApJS...63..543S), Leir (1976, M.Sc. Thesis, Toronto Univ.) as reported
by Struble and Rood (1987ApJS...63..543S), and Corwin 1972
unpublished).

EXPLANATION OF THE TABLES:

Column        Contents


Abell         Running number ("Abell" number) in order of right ascension for
              1855 as listed by Abell (1958ApJS....3..211A) for the northern
              clusters (1 to 2712) and in order of right ascension for 1950 for
              the southern clusters (2713 to 4076).  The supplementary southern
              clusters are numbered from S1 to S1174.

Position      Right Ascension and Declination for 1950 of the apparent cluster
  (1950)      center.  When the cluster was found in more than one field, a
              mean position is listed.  Abell and Corwin used overlays
              positioned with respect to SAO stars to estimate the position,
              while Olowin calculated positions from his measured rectangular
              coordinates.  Thus, Olowin's positions were given double weight
              when means were taken.

Field         The Southern Sky Survey Field number in which the cluster is
              located.  For clusters found in two or more fields, the field
              given is the one in which the cluster is closest to the plate
              center.

xcen, ycen    Rectangular coordinates in millimeters of the apparent cluster
              center, referred to the CENTER of the Southern Sky Survey Field
              given in the previous column.  The field centers are defined by
              the crosses near the edges of the plates.  The positive x
              direction is to the east (left) and the positive y direction is
              to the north (top).  These are in the same sense as the
              rectangular coordinates given by Lauberts (1983, Cat. VII/34) in
              the ESO/Uppsala Catalogue, and are listed to facilitate location
              of the cluster on the 5 x 5-degree ESO 1.0-m Schmidt portion of
              the Southern Sky Survey.  Abell and Corwin measured rectangular
              coordinates from the left and bottom edges of the plates, so
              the xcen and ycen from their data are calculated assuming that
              the plate center is 164 millimeters from the left and bottom
              crosses on the plates (they also measured the crosses).  Olowin
              referred his rectangular coordinates directly to the plate center
              as defined by the crosses, so no transformation is necessary for
              his data.

Abell Type    Cluster classification in Abell's system:  I = irregular, R =
              regular, IR and RI = intermediate.  ":" indicates a mean type
              with differences between estimates of two steps, or an uncertain
              type estimate; "?" indicates a mean type with differences
              between estimates of three steps, or a questionable type
              estimate.

Bautz-Morgan  Classification in the Bautz-Morgan system (Bautz and Morgan
  Type        1970ApJ...162L.149B).  ":" indicates a mean type with differences
              between estimates of two steps, or an uncertain type estimate; "?"
              indicates a mean type with differences between estimates of three
              or more steps, or a questionable type estimate.  For the
              northern Abell catalogue, these types are primarily from Leir
              and van den Bergh (1977ApJS...34..381L).  Other sources for the
              northern catalogue are Bautz and Morgan (1970ApJ...162L.149B),
              Bautz (1972AJ.....77....1B), Corwin (1974AJ.....79.1356C),
              Kristian et al. (1978ApJ...221..383K), Sandage et al.
              (1976ApJ...205..688S), and White (1978ApJ...226..591W).

Count         Number of cluster members between m3 and m3+2, corrected for
              background contamination using the "universal" luminosity
              function from Rainey (1976, Ph.D. Univ. California, Los Angeles).
              The southern counts are corrected to the system of the northern
              catalogue (see text).

m1            Weighted mean total V magnitude estimate for the first-ranked
              cluster member.  NO GALACTIC EXTINCTION CORRECTION HAS BEEN
              APPLIED.  ":" indicates a mean magnitude with a standard
              deviation of more than +-0.5 mag, or an uncertain magnitude
              estimate.  "?" indicates a mean magnitude with a standard
              deviation of more than +-1.0 mag, or a questionable magnitude
              estimate.  "*" indicates that the magnitude estimate is for a
              known or probable foreground object.

m3            Weighted mean total V magnitude estimate for the third-ranked
              cluster member, again UNCORRECTED for galactic extinction.
              Uncertainty symbols as for m1.

m10           Weighted mean total V magnitude estimate for the tenth-ranked
              cluster member, again UNCORRECTED for galactic extinction.
              Uncertainty symbols as for m1 and m3.

Position      RA and Dec of the apparent cluster center precessed to the
  (2000)      equinox of 2000.

              Even though all questionable cases of cross identification were
              checked on the Southern Sky Survey, there remain a few uncertain
              cases.  These are given in the Notes to the Catalogue.

xll, yll      Rectangular coordinates of the apparent cluster center, referred
              to the south-east (lower left) edge of the Southern Sky Survey
              Field given in the first line.  The field edges are defined by
              the crosses near the edges of the plates; thus, it is possible
              for these coordinates to be negative.  For the northern Abell
              catalogue, these coordinates are from Rood and Sastry
              (1971PASP...83..313R).  Olowin's data were transformed assuming
              that the plate center is 164 millimeters from the crosses.

l and b       Galactic coordinates of the apparent cluster centers,
              calculated from the 1950 equatorial coordinates.

z             Cluster redshift from the lists by Struble and Rood
              (1987ApJS...63..555S, northern Abell clusters), Huchra's 1986
              collection of published redshifts (Huchra, private communication),
              Fairall (1985, Cape Town Univ., Astronomy Department Publ. 7),
              Corwin (1981, Ph.D. Thesis, Univ. Edinburgh; see also Corwin
              and Emerson 1982MNRAS.200..621C), Couch and Newell
              (1984ApJS...56..143C and private communication), Noonan
              (1981ApJS...45..613N), and Spinrad (private communication).
              The redshift is in parentheses if it is more than 0.3 dex from the
              expected redshift for the cluster's m10. Redshifts from Huchra's
              list and from Fairall (1985, Cape Town Univ. Publ. 7) were
              determined by selecting all galaxies with known redshifts within
              one Abell radius of the cluster center, rejecting discordant
              redshifts, and averaging the remainder.

R             Richness class as defined by Abell (1958ApJS....3..211A).  For the
              northern Abell catalogue, this is Abell's original richness class.

D             Distance class corresponding to Abell's (1958ApJS....3..211A)
              criteria.  For the northern Abell catalogue, this is Abell's
              original distance class from his m10.  For the southern catalogue,
              these are from the m10A's listed in the next column.

m10A          Magnitude for the tenth-ranked cluster member in Abell's
              (1958ApJS....3..211A) system, corrected for galactic extinction
              following Abell's formula.  For the northern Abell catalogue,
              this is Abell's original magnitude.  For the southern catalogue,
              these were transformed from the m10 on the first line (see text).

Number and    Number of fields in which the cluster was found, and the
  Observers   observer's initial (A = Abell, C = Corwin, O = Olowin).
