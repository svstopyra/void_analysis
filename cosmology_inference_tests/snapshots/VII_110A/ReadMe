Description:
    This is an all-sky catalog of 4073 rich clusters of galaxies, each
    having at least 30 members within the magnitude range m_3_ to m_3_ + 2
    (m_3_ is the magnitude of the third brightest cluster member) and each
    with a nominal redshift less than 0.2. The southern data have been
    collected from a survey of UK 1.2 m Schmidt telescope IIIa-J plates
    and films and have been reduced to the systems defined by the northern
    data previously published by G.O. Abell. A revised northern catalog,
    including Bautz-Morgan types and redshifts where known, is also
    included.

Nomenclature Notes:
    The recommended acronym used to designate the clusters from
    this list (the "Abell" clusters) is:
    ACO      (numbers 1 through 4076, 1-2712 being Northern,
              2713-4076 Southern)
    ACO S    (numbers 1 through 1174), supplementary Southern clusters.
    In the literature, the following acronyms have also been found:
    A , Abell, ABCG, AC, S (the last for supplementary Southern clusters)

Historical Notes:
  * The files of notes were provided by courtesy of H.G.Corwin to H.
    Andernach; it was numbered A145 in H. Andernach's "List of Astronomical
    Catalogues and Documents kindly provided on request by various authors"

  * In this revised version (VII/110A), the tables 7A, 7B and 7C
    of the paper are appended. The document file, tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 of
    the previous version (VII/110) have not been changed, except
    removing spaces between '+/-' signs and data, other than the
    rectangular coordinates in tables 4, 5, and 6.
  * In the tables 7A-7C archived here, following changes were made:
    A letter 'A' was added in front of the northern cluster number.
    The string 'ASnnnn' for a cluster name was changed to 'Snnnn'.
    All Abell cluster names are strictly mentioned in the format (A1,I4),
    e.g. 'A  12' also in the text.
  * 14-Mar-1994: First archived, Koichi Nakajima <nakajima@higashi.hit-u.ac.jp>
    (The date of the latest archiving, see the date of each file)
  * 28-Oct-1995: Inserted zeroes between sign and values of Xcen/Ycen
    values in tables 4 and 5.
  * 11-Dec-1999: Merged the notes into a single file
  * 26-Feb-2004: the missing values of m1 in table4 (3163) and table5 (S286)
    have been added, thanks to H. Andernach and Harold Corwin.
  * 28-Mar-2007: in table3, BM type corrected fril "I-III" into "I-II:"
    for cluster 2503 (private comm. by H. Corwin Jr. to H. Andernach)
